</p>

<p>
This project performs clustering on MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality data using machine learning techniques.<br>
It identifies patterns in peopleâ€™s writing styles and groups them into personality clusters.<br>
The project is implemented as an interactive <strong>Streamlit</strong> web app.
</p>

<p>
This app analyzes MBTI personality types using clustering on real-world text data 
(<em>MBTI dataset from Kaggle</em>).
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
The goal of this project is to uncover hidden personality groupings by applying 
unsupervised learning on text data. Users can explore clusters, view their dominant MBTI types, 
and test which cluster their own writing fits into.
